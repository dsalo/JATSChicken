# JATSChicken
JATS markup for Doug Zongker's justly-famous "Chicken Chicken" article (https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf)

I did this in a tearing hurry for my LIS 652 "XML and Linked Data" course. Pull requests welcome, if anybody has the patience and doesn't mind hating the word "chicken" forever after.

I'm fine with anyone reusing this, but I didn't ask Doug Zongker first, so you might want to. I'm not responsible if you don't.

Known issues:

* The math isn't math, sorry.
* I didn't do the initial colgroup in the table correctly.

Possible issues:

* Missing italics; I think I got them all, but I may well have missed something.
* Missing cross-references
* Missing figure references (where the heck IS the ref to Figure -- that is, Chicken 1?)
